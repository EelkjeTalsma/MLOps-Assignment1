# MLOps - Question 3: Version Control Setup (Git & GitHub)
Context: Professional ML projects require version control from day one. Setting up very specific
software stacks can become complicated quite quickly. Setting up Git on a shared cluster with
proper authentication and .gitignore rules is never trivial.
# Tasks to Complete:
(a) Initialize a Git repository on Snellius
(b) Create proper .gitignore and README.md files
(c) Make at least one commit
(d) Push to a remote GitHub repository
# Answer the following
1. Provide the URL of your GitHub repository
2. When you first tried to git push, what authentication method did you use (HTTPS with
token, SSH key, or GitHub CLI)? Describe any errors you encountered during authentication setup.
Include the error message if you received one.
3. Show the contents of your .gitignore file. Then answer:
• What are important things to include in the .gitignore?
• Should you include information about how to access Snellius and load the necessary software in your README.md?
4. Paste the output of git log –oneline showing your first commit(s). The commit messages and timestamps will be verified against GitHub’s records.
